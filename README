I. About
  AlphaOS is an Operating System originally created by Robert Schofield and 
  Matthew Carey, as a way to experiment with our knowledge in the different
  programming languages, like Assembly, C, and C++.  It currently is in the
  very early stages of development and does not have a bootloader yet that 
  works with a disk. This will change in the coming months, as we will 
  create our own bootloader, and allow the usage of grub with it as well.

  To build the kernel:
    make kernel

  To test it out:
    qemu -kernel build/Kernel.bin

II. List of C Commands:

  printf("Text to Print")    ...     Prints the text in the parenthesis with a black background.
  
  print("Text to Print", Background Color, Foreground Color)     
			     ...    Prints the text in parenthesis with the designated background
			            and foreground colors. These are both numbers.
