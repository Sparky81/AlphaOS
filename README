AlphaOS is an Operating System originally created by Robert Schofield and 
Matthew Carey, as a way to experiment with our knowledge in the different
programming languages, like Assembly, C, and C++.  It currently is in the
very early stages of development and does not have a bootloader yet that 
works with a disk. This will change in the coming months, as we will 
create our own bootloader and allow the usage of grub with it as well.

To build the kernel:
  make kernel

To test it out:
  qemu -kernel build/Kernel.bin
