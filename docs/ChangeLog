   I've made changes to /Makefile to correct the (attempted) use of coloring
   in the echos. The issue was that it was not called with the -e flag for
   echo. Now you may use @$(SAY) "\033[37mHello World!\033[0m". I've also added
   this changelog, because I'm usually anxious to push anyway, so it's easier
   to type here than in the commit message. As well as this file will be 
   visible if I make multiple commits so that Robert doesn't have to
   backtrack through them all to see my reasoning. This file does not have to
   be put in .:|:. casing, it will be sort of a signatre of mine so you'll
   know before even reading that I have made changes.

   Just did a test on strlen, it works correctly. Yay.
